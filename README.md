# Leukemai-detection-using-deep-learning

The main objective is to build a neural network that can classify human blood smear image and
identify the status (diagnosis) of cell where it is normal or it is a leukemia cell, where human
blood is the main source to detect diseases at earlier stage and can prevent it quickly, the system
can be automated in order to produce lab results quickly, easily and efficiently
